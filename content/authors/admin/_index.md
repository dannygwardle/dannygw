I am currently a casual academic tutor at the University of Adelaide. In 2021, I completed a Master of Philosophy degree. My MPhil thesis consisted of three papers discussing and defending a form of perdurantism. I also discussed how perdurantists ought to respond to some issues arising from philosophy of language and non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Before that, I completed a Bachelor of Arts (Advanced) at the same university.

I am an Ordinary Member of the Australasian Association of Philosophy (AAP) Postgraduate Committee. In 2020, I was the Convenor of that committee.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in analytic metaphysics. I am also interested in topics at the intersection of metaphysics, philosophy of physics, and philosophy of language. I am currently working on preparing some of my MPhil work for publication. 

Outside of philosophy, I enjoy scuba diving down at Port Noarlunga and Rapid Bay.
